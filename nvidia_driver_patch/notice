Here is a copy of a git repository found at https://github.com/sk1080/nvidia-kvm-patcher.git

I DID NOT MAKE THIS

Refer to the above original repository for updates!
I'm putting this here for completeness and just in case that repo is ever taken down.

It is extremely helpful as it will allow you to use an nvidia card in a vm without disabling any vm features!

to enable test signing, run cmd as admin and execute:
Bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON
and reboot.

Remeber to turn it of again when you're done.
